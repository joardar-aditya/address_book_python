# address_book_python

This is a simple Address book application created using Python.

The main aim is to show the application of ProtoBuffers for creating simple APIs for storing and retreiving structured data easily.

Other methods like pickling can also be used but protobuffers are supported by various languages like JAVA, C++, C# etc. Thus the
client and master applications can be written in the language of any choice.

#### the .proto file shows the basic schema of the address book database
